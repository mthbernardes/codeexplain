# codeexplain.nvim

`codeexplain.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that uses the powerful [GPT4ALL](https://gpt4all.io/) language model to provide on-the-fly, line-by-line explanations and potential security vulnerabilities for selected code directly in your Neovim editor. It's like having your personal code assistant right inside your editor without leaking your codebase to any company.
